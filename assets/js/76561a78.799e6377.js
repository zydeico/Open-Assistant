Thanks to\\neveryone, and especially community members who supported us so far!\\n\\nOur current plan for the architecture of the Open Assistant is as follows:\\n\\n```mermaid\\nflowchart TD\\n  subgraph next[Web Frontend]\\n    direction TB\\n    website([Browser]) & nextbackend[Backend] & webpostgres[(PostgreSQL)]\\n  end\\n\\n  subgraph data[Python backend]\\n    direction TB\\n    backend[Backend] & postgres[(PostgreSQL)] & redis[(Redis)]\\n  end\\n\\n  subgraph inference[Inference Service]\\n    direction TB\\n    inferenceServer[Server] -.- infpostgres[(PostgreSQL)]\\n  end\\n\\n  subgraph workers[Inference Workers]\\n    direction TB\\n    worker1[Worker] --- textgen1[Text\\\\ngenerator]\\n    worker2[Worker] --- textgen2[Text\\\\ngenerator]\\n    worker3[Worker] --- textgen3[Text\\\\ngenerator]\\n  end\\n\\n  website --\x3e nextbackend\\n  nextbackend -.- webpostgres\\n\\n  next --- data\\n\\n  backend -.- postgres & redis\\n\\n  next --- inference\\n\\n  inference --- workers\\n```\\n\\nWe are working on setting up the inference as shown above, and considering our\\noptions for hosting, also, we want to move our authentication from the website\\nto the python backend.\\n\\nOf course, this is by no means final, and lot of questions are still open, and\\nthat is the fun of it!
