Thanks to\neveryone, and especially community members who supported us so far!</p><p>Our current plan for the architecture of the Open Assistant is as follows:</p><p>We are working on setting up the inference as shown above, and considering our\noptions for hosting, also, we want to move our authentication from the website\nto the python backend.</p><p>Of course, this is by no means final, and lot of questions are still open, and\nthat is the fun of it!
